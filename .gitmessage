component: Some awesome subject

Why:

- …

What:

- …

Bug: #1234
#
# - Subject should be 50 characters or less
# - Separate body from subject
# - Use imperative mood, avoid passive voice
# - Wrap the body text at 72 chars
# 
# Explain "why" and "what". If it does not make sense to include
# this in your commit message, then delete those sections.
#
# Don't forget the Bug: line
# Don't leave a blank line after the Bug: line
#
# If you are unsure about what to use for component:
#  - "fetch" for src/commands/fetch.ts and related parser updates
#  - "analyzer" for src/lib/analyzer.ts or shared analysis helpers
#  - "notes" for Community Note builders/publishers
#  - "show" for CLI/HTML report output
#  - "dkg" for publishing/config/dkg.js integration changes
#
# Hint: you can enable this to be used as a template for git commit
# git config commit.template .gitmessage
