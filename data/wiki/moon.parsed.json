Although only a few [[multi-ring basins]] have been definitively dated, they are useful for assigning relative ages. Because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate, counting the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface.<ref name=\"geologic\" />\nHowever care needs to be exercised with the [[crater counting]] technique due to the potential presence of [[secondary crater]]s. Ejecta from impacts can create secondary craters that often appear in clusters or chains but can also occur as isolated formations at a considerable distance from the impact. These can resemble primary craters, and may even dominate small crater populations, so their unidentified presence can distort age estimates.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Xiao |first1=Z. |last2=Strom |first2=R.G. |year=2012 |title=Problems determining relative and absolute ages using the small crater population |journal=Icarus |volume=220 |issue=1 |pages=254–267 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2012.05.012 |bibcode=2012Icar..220..254X |url=https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/planetology/lectures/ss2015/143897-hottopics/xiao_and_strom_2012.pdf}}</ref>",
